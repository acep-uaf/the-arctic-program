description = "The ARCTIC program was modeled on the Asia-Pacific Technology and Education Partnership (APTEP) funded through ONR. ARCTIC’s original three fundamental pillars of 'Education and Workforce, Research and Technology, and Business and Marketplace' were derived from APTEP. After several iterations, these pillars have been adapted into five thematic foundational activities: Resiliency Research, Modeling Observations and Data, Technology Testing and Implementation, Education and Workforce Development, and Innovation Economy Development."

ARCTIC’s five foundational activities are deeply integrated with partners at the local and state levels. Guided by a cross-cutting Program Management and Support task, these activities exemplify the collaborative efforts driving Alaska’s resilience and innovation economy. The figure above illustrates how these foundational activities are achieved through partnerships across a dynamic ecosystem.
