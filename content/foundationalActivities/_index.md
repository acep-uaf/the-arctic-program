description = "The ARCTIC program was modeled on the Asia-Pacific Technology and Education Partnership (APTEP) funded through ONR. ARCTIC’s original three fundamental pillars of 'Education and Workforce, Research and Technology, and Business and Marketplace' were derived from APTEP. After several iterations, these pillars have been adapted into five thematic foundational activities: Resiliency Research, Modeling Observations and Data, Technology Testing and Implementation, Education and Workforce Development, and Innovation Economy Development. These foundational activities are supported by a cross cutting Program Management and Support task that includes the architecture for the direct involvement of partner communities in this work."
