paragraph = "The ARCTIC program, originally modeled on the Asia-Pacific Technology and Education Partnership (APTEP) funded by ONR, evolved its three foundational pillars—‘Education and Workforce, Research and Technology, and Business and Marketplace’—into five thematic activities: Resiliency Research, Modeling Observations and Data, Technology Testing and Implementation, Education and Workforce Development, and Innovation Economy Development. These activities, deeply integrated with local and state partners, are guided by a cross-cutting Program Management and Support task, exemplifying collaboration to advance Alaska’s resilience and innovation economy. The accompanying figure demonstrates how these foundational activities are achieved through partnerships across the dynamic ecosystem."
