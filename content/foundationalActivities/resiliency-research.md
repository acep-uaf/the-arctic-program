Energy research under the ARCTIC program is led by ACEP, an applied energy research institute at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. ACEPâ€™s research focuses on sustainable energy systems for islanded, non-integrated electric grids, including space heating and transportation. ARCTIC program research spans disciplines and inherently requires close collaboration with external stakeholders such as utilities and communities, including co-design of research objectives and project implementation. This work has led to extensive partnering both within and beyond the Alaska research ecosystem.
