The ARCTIC program promotes and advocates for regional resiliency through research, technology development/deployment in energy and other key interconnected areas such as security of food, energy and water systems as well as climate security. A unique value proposition of the ARCTIC program is our expert-led support for deployment and demonstration projects. ACEP works with our community partners to co-develop, evaluate, and identify opportunities to demonstrate new technologies and improve the adoption and adaptation of existing technologies to meet changing local needs.
