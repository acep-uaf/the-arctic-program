During the past five years, we have seen the number of communities that can achieve high penetration, diesel off-operation expanded from three to over a dozen. The total installed capacity across all renewable energy technologies has also steadily increased despite reductions in state funding. Much of this results from increased know-how and capacity at the state and local levels, meaning these projects are being developed, operated, and maintained successfully."
