### Research Objectives
Funded by ONR and augmented by other federal and state funding sources, the ARCTIC program is constantly evolving to meet Alaska’s energy research needs and advance sustainable & community-approved solutions.

Currently, ARCTIC objectives focus on:
- Proving the feasibility of innovative, Arctic-ready energy solutions
- Building local expertise to address energy transition challenges
- Expanding Alaska’s innovation ecosystem with inclusive, community-based engagement.
- Demonstrating the viability and replicability of high levels of renewable energy in microgrids


### Capacity Building Success and Challenges

    <div class="text-content">
        <p>The ARCTIC program has been invaluable for building capacity and stimulating dynamic growth within the state of Alaska. During the past five years, we have seen the number of communities that can achieve high penetration, diesel off-operation expanded 
from three to over a dozen. The total installed capacity across all renewable energy technologies has also steadily increased despite reductions in state funding. Much of this results from increased know-how and capacity at the state and local levels, meaning these projects are being developed, operated, and maintained successfully.</p>

        <p>Increased capacity at ACEP has mirrored increased installed renewable capacity across the state. ACEP’s rising profile as a leading source of energy research expertise within the state, nation, and internationally has resulted in a 500% increase in base funding from the State of Alaska. This has allowed ACEP to expand faculty and research staffing and to be increasingly successful in securing competitive research funding from the Dept. of Energy and the National Science Foundation, along with supporting the success of our community partners with their community-led efforts. ACEP and ARCTIC program partners across the state are working to seed new ideas, expand early-stage initiatives, and sustain successful, proven capacity-building efforts with the end goal of moving our research from the lab to the real world. To achieve this, ARCTIC leadership is designing a program that intentionally and continually stimulates capacity development while pushing the envelope on what is technically and economically feasible.</p>

<div class="image-text-flexbox">
    <div class="text-content">
        <p>Since 2017 the ARCTIC program has partnered with over 200 organizations across diverse sectors, to advance resilient energy solutions for Alaska and the Arctic. Our core leadership includes three University of Alaska entities—ACEP, Center ICE, and CED—alongside key partners REAP and Launch Alaska, forming a strong partnership for sustainable energy innovation.</p>

### National Security & Department of Defense (DoD) Relevance
Aligned with the Arctic strategic goals of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and Navy, ARCTIC builds regional capacity for resilient energy infrastructure and enhance energy security. This includes developing sustainable energy and technology solutions while protecting the environment across the Arctic and Pacific regions ensuring that remote and islanded communities are prepared to meet the complex challenges of the future.

The Navy’s 2021 [A Blue Arctic: a Strategic Blueprint for the Arctic](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jan/05/2002560338/-1/-1/0/ARCTIC%20BLUEPRINT%202021-%20FINAL.PDF/ARCTIC%20BLUEPRINT%202021%20FINAL.PDF) highlights the ARCTIC program as a key example of how investing in public-private partnerships and innovative solutions can advance operational capabilities in the North as well as the overall well-being and resilience of Alaskan communities.
