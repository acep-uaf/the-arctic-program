### Research Objectives
Funded by ONR and augmented by other federal and state funding sources, the ARCTIC program is constantly evolving to meet Alaska’s energy research needs and advance sustainable & community-approved solutions.

Currently, ARCTIC objectives focus on:
- Proving the feasibility of innovative, Arctic-ready energy solutions
- Building local expertise to address energy transition challenges
- Expanding Alaska’s innovation ecosystem with inclusive, community-based engagement.
- Demonstrating the viability and replicability of high levels of renewable energy in microgrids


### Capacity Building Success and Challenges

        <p>The ARCTIC program has been invaluable for building capacity and stimulating dynamic growth within the state of Alaska. During the past five years, we have seen the number of communities that can achieve high penetration, diesel off-operation expanded 
from three to over a dozen. The total installed capacity across all renewable energy technologies has also steadily increased despite reductions in state funding. Much of this results from increased know-how and capacity at the state and local levels, meaning these projects are being developed, operated, and maintained successfully.</p>

### National Security & Department of Defense (DoD) Relevance
Aligned with the Arctic strategic goals of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and Navy, ARCTIC builds regional capacity for resilient energy infrastructure and enhance energy security. This includes developing sustainable energy and technology solutions while protecting the environment across the Arctic and Pacific regions ensuring that remote and islanded communities are prepared to meet the complex challenges of the future.

The Navy’s 2021 [a Blue Arctic: A Strategic Blueprint for the Arctic](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jan/05/2002560338/-1/-1/0/ARCTIC%20BLUEPRINT%202021-%20FINAL.PDF/ARCTIC%20BLUEPRINT%202021%20FINAL.PDF) highlights the ARCTIC program as a key example of how investing in public-private partnerships and innovative solutions can advance operational capabilities in the North as well as the overall well-being and resilience of Alaskan communities.
