The Alaska Regional Collaboration for Technology Innovation and Commercialization (ARCTIC) program is an Office of Naval (ONR) program established in 2017 in support of Navyâ€™s needs for public-private partnerships promoting commerce and collaboration between Alaska and the Arctic and Pacific regions, centered around energy and resiliency research. Established in 2017, the ARCTIC program is an Office of Naval Research initiative designed to help Alaskan organizations and communities develop a thriving innovation ecosystem through energy resiliency research, technology development/deployment, and education. 

ARCTIC leverages and augments existing capacity and accelerates the energy transition in Alaska and the North, while also building key partnerships between Alaska and the Arctic and Pacific regions. Our vision for capacity building under the ARCTIC program centers on sustainable, cost-effective energy solutions implemented with the following principles: Research and technology development is community-led and addresses local, self-identified economic needs; Alaskans are leaders and key partners in U.S. research and innovation Alaskan communities and small businesses thrive through economic diversification and development.
